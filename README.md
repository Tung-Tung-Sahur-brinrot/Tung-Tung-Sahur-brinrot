### 🎮 A Gesture-Controlled Gaming Interface — Powered by Chaos, Code, and Clean Hands

*Tung Tung Sahur brinrot* proudly presents a new way to play — no controller, no joystick, no hardware hacks.  
**Just you, your webcam, and your hands turning into a game controller.**

---

## 🧠 What’s the Big Idea?

This system detects **both hands**, tracks their motion in real-time, and builds a **virtual axis** between your palms.  
As this axis shifts, rotates, or gestures — the game's universe reacts.  
Think Minority Report... but built in Python and caffeine.

## 🔍 How It Works

- ✅ Real-time hand tracking using your webcam
- 🧭 Virtual axis formed between both hands
- ✊🤚 Gesture recognition triggers in-game actions
- 🎮 Components move based on the axis's behavior
- 🖥️ No hardware — fully software based

---

## ✨ Features

- 👐 Dual-hand tracking like a pro
- 🎯 Gesture-based input (static + dynamic)
- 🎮 Game logic mapped to your actual movement
- 🔄 Real-time feedback loop
- ⚡ Super low-latency experience (optimized for speed)
